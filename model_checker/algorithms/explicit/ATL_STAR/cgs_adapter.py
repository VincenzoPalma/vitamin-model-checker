"""Adapts a VITAMIN `CGS` (matching `CGSProtocol`) into an `automata.TransitionSystem`.

Action cells hold comma-separated joint-action profiles, each either
`|`-separated (one token per agent) or one character per agent, both
real formats, per VITAMIN's own `cgs_actions.parse_joint_action_cell`.
Extra tokens beyond `number_of_agents` are dropped, not an error;
`"I"`/`"IDLE"` normalize to one canonical idle token.

A wildcard (`"*"`) cell means "self-loop on the source state, for any
action" (per `cgs_utils.get_edges`/`graph_relations.labeled_pairs`,
regardless of which column it's in). Materialized as an explicit
self-loop for every action already used elsewhere in the CGS, added after
the whole graph is built, and skipped for any action the source already
has a real destination for. If the whole CGS never defines a single real
action (every cell is a wildcard), falls back to one synthetic all-"*"
joint action instead of leaving the state with no transitions at all.

Reads `cgs.graph` via `get_edges()` instead of a raw O(states^2) scan of
the dense state x state matrix (cached on a real VITAMIN `CGS` until
`cgs.graph` changes). Since VITAMIN's `get_edges()` collapses a wildcard's
target to its own source regardless of column, a self-referencing edge is
ambiguous (genuine diagonal self-loop, a wildcard, or both) and can't be
trusted from `get_edges()` alone, those states fall back to a full row
scan; `source != target` edges are read directly (unambiguous).
