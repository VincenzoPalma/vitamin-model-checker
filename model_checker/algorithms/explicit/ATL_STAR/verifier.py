"""Bottom-up elimination algorithm for ATL* model checking, built on
automata's Automaton/product/arena/solver pipeline.

`sat(formula, model)` computes formula bottom-up on the AST. The only
non-trivial case is `Coalition(agents, psi)`: `psi` may itself contain
nested `Coalition` subformulas, so `_eliminate` first replaces every
maximal one with a fresh proposition labelling the states where it already
holds (via `_solve_coalition`, which also records that inner coalition's
witness into `Witness.nested`, see `witness` below) — what's left is pure
LTL, translatable via `Automaton.from_ltl`. The automaton is producted
with the CGS, unfolded into a turn-based arena for `agents` vs. everyone
else, and solved as a parity/Büchi/co-Büchi game; `Coalition`'s truth set
is player 0's winning region projected onto the automaton's initial state.

`_sat_coalition` needs a verdict for every CGS state, not just the model's
declared initial one, so it probes the product from every state at once —
`solve()`/`product()`/`complete()` already support that (multiple initial
states, and a possibly-partial `Automaton.from_ltl` transition function).

    start reading it.

    `strategy` is a Mealy machine keyed by `(cgs_state, automaton_state)`
    pairs, not bare CGS states — the automaton state is the memory needed to
    resolve the formula's temporal structure (e.g. whether an `U`'s left side
    already held). `start` is that pair at the state `witness()` was asked
    about; `strategy.move(start)` gives the coalition's first joint move.
    `formula.agents` own that move jointly — split it onto one agent's own
    action via `Strategy.project`.

    `nested` carries, for every `Coalition` subformula eliminated out of
    `formula`'s path formula (allowed anywhere, arbitrarily deep, in ATL*),
    that inner coalition's own witness — keyed first by its internal marker
    name (meaningless on its own), then by the CGS state it applies from.
    Most formulas have none; look it up via `nested_witnesses_at` rather than
    the marker names directly. Each inner `Witness` carries its own `nested`
    too, so nesting composes without special-casing depth.

    `product_ts` is the underlying product transition system `advance` walks,
    rarely touched directly.
