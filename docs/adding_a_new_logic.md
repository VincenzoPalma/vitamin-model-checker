# Adding a New Logic

The recommended way to add a new logic is to build a
`vitamin-module-integrator` bundle, validate it there, and let VMI apply the
files and entry points to this repository.

Manual changes in this repo are still useful for maintainers changing built-in
logics or core contracts. Keep those changes small and test them directly in
`model_checker/tests/`.

## Recommended Path: VMI Bundle

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    source["New logic source"]
    bundle["VMI bundle"]
    validate["VMI validation"]
    integrate["VMI integration"]
    target["vitamin-model-checker"]
    tests["VMC tests and benchmarks"]

    source --> bundle --> validate --> integrate --> target --> tests
```

Use this path when the logic is meant to be packaged and integrated as a module.
VMI checks the manifest, folder layout, parser/checker contracts, dependencies,
collisions, example execution, and post-integration runtime behavior.

At a high level, the bundle provides:

- a parser package under `parsers/formulas/<LogicName>/`, unless it reuses an
  existing parser,
- an algorithm package under `algorithms/explicit/<LogicName>/`,
- optional game-structure code under `parsers/game_structures/<name>/`,
- examples and tests,
- `vitamin_module.yaml` describing the logic, parser, checker, model type,
  dependencies, examples, tests, and optional extra paths.

After integration, VMI patches this repository's `pyproject.toml` entry points,
copies files into the right package locations, updates managed metadata, and
runs post-integration verification.

## What The Checker Must Return

Every public checker function should return a plain dict.

Success responses should include:

- `res`: the satisfying state set as a string,
- `initial_state`: whether the initial state satisfies the formula.

Error responses should include:

- `error`: a clear message or structured error payload.

Use the existing helpers instead of inventing a result shape:

- `format_model_checking_result`
- `verify_initial_state`
- `model_checker.utils.error_handler`

Good references are the ATL, OATL, CTL, and COTL implementations.

## Parser Choices

### New Formula Parser

Add a parser package under:

```text
model_checker/parsers/formulas/<LogicName>/
```

The parser class should follow the shape of existing parser classes and be
registered through `pyproject.toml` entry points after integration:

```toml
[project.entry-points."vitamin.parsers"]
MyLogic = "model_checker.parsers.formulas.MyLogic.parser:MyLogicParser"
```

### Reuse An Existing Parser

If your logic uses the same formula syntax as another logic, reuse that parser.
For example, COTL uses the OATL parser:

```toml
[project.entry-points."vitamin.parsers"]
COTL = "model_checker.parsers.formulas.OATL.parser:OATLParser"
```

This is the preferred approach when syntax is genuinely shared. Do not copy a
parser only to change the logic name.

## Algorithm Shape

Add the algorithm under:

```text
model_checker/algorithms/explicit/<LogicName>/
```

Expose:

```python
def model_checking(formula: str, filename: str) -> dict:
    ...
```

Inside the public function, call:

```python
execute_model_checking_with_parser(
    formula,
    filename,
    "<LogicName>",
    _core_my_logic_checking,
)
```

The core function receives the parsed model object and the formula. It should:

1. get the parser through `FormulaParserFactory`,
2. parse the formula,
3. evaluate the formula over the model,
4. format the result through shared helpers,
5. return error dicts through `model_checker.utils.error_handler` helpers.

Avoid global model state. The model for each run is the object passed by the
engine execution layer.

## Model Type Mapping

If your logic uses an existing model type, map it to the right parser behavior:

- `CGS`
- `costCGS`
- `capCGS`

For built-in manual changes, update `model_checker/parsers/model_parser_factory.py`
where the existing logic-to-model-type sets are maintained.

If the logic needs a new game structure, add the parser package under:

```text
model_checker/parsers/game_structures/<name>/
```

Then register the model type through entry points:

```toml
[project.entry-points."vitamin.models"]
MyModelType = "model_checker.parsers.game_structures.my_model.my_model:MyModel"
```

VMI can copy and register custom game-structure files when the bundle manifest
declares them.

## Entry Points

This repository uses Python entry points as the package-level integration
contract.

| Group | Required when |
|---|---|
| `vitamin.parsers` | The logic has or reuses a formula parser. |
| `vitamin.benchmarks` | The logic should be callable by benchmark tooling. |
| `vitamin.metadata` | The logic exposes parser/package metadata. |
| `vitamin.models` | A new game-structure model type is added. |

For VMI bundles, the integrator updates these entries during integration. For
manual maintainer changes, update `pyproject.toml` directly and run the tests.

## Tests And Examples

Add tests under `model_checker/tests/`:

- parser unit tests for new syntax,
- algorithm unit tests for tricky helper behavior,
- integration tests under `integration/algorithms/<logic>/`,
- interface tests if the public cross-logic behavior changes,
- performance tests only when runtime behavior needs a guard.

Add examples under the repo-root `examples/` directory when the logic should be
visible to demo flows:

```text
examples/<model_type>/<LogicName>/
├── my_model.txt
└── my_model_formula.txt
```

The formula file can contain multiple semicolon-terminated formulas.

## COTL Example

COTL shares OATL surface syntax but has its own parser and algorithm over
`costCGS`.

What it needs:

1. a dedicated parser under `model_checker/parsers/formulas/COTL/` (subclassing
   `OATLParser` when syntax matches),
2. `COTL` listed as cost-based in `model_parser_factory.py`,
3. an algorithm module under `algorithms/explicit/COTL/`,
4. entry points for parser, benchmark callable, and metadata,
5. integration tests and example costCGS models.

Register the parser with its own entry point, for example:

```toml
COTL = "model_checker.parsers.formulas.COTL.parser:COTLParser"
```

Do not point the `COTL` entry point at `OATL.parser:OATLParser`; that breaks
parser discovery and formula validation.

## Advanced Manual Checklist

Use this checklist when you are maintaining this repository directly:

- [ ] Add or reuse a parser under `model_checker/parsers/formulas/`.
- [ ] Add the algorithm under `model_checker/algorithms/explicit/`.
- [ ] Expose `model_checking(formula, filename) -> dict`.
- [ ] Use `execute_model_checking_with_parser(...)`.
- [ ] Update model type mapping if needed.
- [ ] Add or update `pyproject.toml` entry points.
- [ ] Add tests under `model_checker/tests/`.
- [ ] Add examples if the logic should appear in demo flows.
- [ ] Run `pytest model_checker/tests/`.
- [ ] Run benchmarks from `vitamin-benchmark-model-checker` if the change can
      affect performance.

## Workbench Notes

Workbench-specific logic descriptions, HTTP request schemas, prompts, and UI
behavior live in the sibling `vitamin-workbench` repository. Do not document
Workbench paths as if they live in this repo.

If a logic needs Workbench support, update this repository first, then make the
corresponding Workbench change in that project.
