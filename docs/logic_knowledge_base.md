# VITAMIN Model Checker - Logic Knowledge Base

## Overview

This is the **cross-logic theory and syntax map** for VITAMIN. For each logic it
covers:

1. **Theoretical background** - standard syntax and semantics from the literature.
2. **Current implementation** - surface grammar, model type, and how theory maps to code.
3. **Comparison** - short theory vs implementation table.
4. **Shared policies** - empty coalitions, proposition tokens, and model formats.

For denotations, fixpoints, validation proofs, and pipeline details, use the
per-logic `docs/<Logic>/algorithm.md` pages (for example
[ICTL/algorithm.md](ICTL/algorithm.md)). For how to author `.txt` models, use
[file_formats.md](file_formats.md).

## Per-logic algorithm pages

The algorithm pages are now split by logic so implementation details are easy
to locate:

- [CTL](CTL/algorithm.md)
- [LTL](LTL/algorithm.md)
- [ATL](ATL/algorithm.md)
- [ATLF](ATLF/algorithm.md)
- [NatATL](NatATL/algorithm.md)
- [NatATLF](NatATLF/algorithm.md)
- [NatSL](NatSL/algorithm.md)
- [OATL](OATL/algorithm.md)
- [OL](OL/algorithm.md)
- [RBATL](RBATL/algorithm.md)
- [RABATL](RABATL/algorithm.md)
- [CapATL](CapATL/algorithm.md)
- [COTL](COTL/algorithm.md)
- [Wallet_ATL](Wallet_ATL/algorithm.md)
- [ICTL](ICTL/algorithm.md)
- [IATL](IATL/algorithm.md)
- [TCTL](TCTL/algorithm.md)
- [TOL](TOL/algorithm.md)

**Logic names:** Full names are used only for logics defined in the VITAMIN paper and standard references (CTL, LTL, ATL). Other implemented logics (OATL, OL, COTL, etc.) are listed by acronym only; their expansions are not fixed in the project literature.

## Boolean Logic (Shared Syntax)

All logics in VITAMIN share a common set of boolean operators and constants.

**Boolean Constants:**
- `true`: Constant true
- `false`: Constant false

**Boolean Operators (Ordered by Precedence):**

| Operator | Syntax | Keyword | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Negation** | `!` | `not` | Logical NOT |
| **Conjunction** | `&&` or `&` | `and` | Logical AND |
| **Disjunction** | `\|\|` or `\|` | `or` | Logical OR |
| **Implication** | `->` or `>` | `implies` | Logical implication (p -> q) |

**Grouping and Nesting:**

| syntax | Description | Supported Logics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `(...)` | Standard grouping | **All** logics |
| `[...]` | Alternate grouping | **CTL ONLY** |

> [!NOTE]
> **Design Rationale:**
> - **CTL** supports `[...]` to maintain compatibility with standard academic notation (e.g., *Baier/Katoen*) where path formulas are traditionally enclosed in square brackets (e.g., `A[p U q]`).
> - **Other logics** (like ATL, NatSL, RBATL) use a variety of specialized brackets for coalitions `<...>`, capacities `{...}`, and bounds `{k}`. To maintain syntactic clarity and avoid "bracket fatigue," these parsers strictly use parentheses `(...)` for logical grouping.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> While parentheses `()` can be used in any logic to define precedence, square brackets `[]` are exclusively supported by the CTL parser. Using `[]` in LTL, ATL, or other logics will result in a syntax error.


**Truth Table:**

```text
   p   |   q   |  !p   | p && q | p || q | p -> q
-------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------
 true  | true  | false |  true  |  true  |  true
 true  | false | false |  false |  true  |  false
 false | true  | true  |  false |  true  |  true
 false | false | true  |  false |  false |  true
```

## CTL - Computation Tree Logic

### Theoretical Background

CTL is a branching-time logic defined over computation trees. Formulas are evaluated at a state and quantify over all possible infinite paths from that state.

**Standard Syntax:**
- **Path Quantifiers:**
    - `E`: There exists a path...
    - `A`: For all paths...
- **Temporal Operators:**
    - `X`: Next state
    - `F`: Eventually (finally)
    - `G`: Globally (always)
    - `U`: Until

**Standard Examples:**
- `AG p`: Always globally p (p is an invariant).
- `EF p`: Eventually p (reachability).
- `AG (p -> AF q)`: Always if p, then eventually q on all paths (liveness/response).

**Traces (optional):** When `generate_trace=True`, the returned path is a
**reachability path into or out of the denotation** of the root formula. It is
**not** a full CTL path witness/counterexample (for example it need not exhibit
a violating suffix for `AG`, nor a lassopath for `EG`/`AF`). Treat traces as
debugging hints only; trust the satisfying state set for semantics.

### Current Implementation

**Parser Location:** `model_checker/parsers/formulas/NatSL/parser.py`

**Implemented Logic Support:**
- **Quantifiers:** bounded existential and universal natural-strategy quantifiers, e.g. `E{2}x` and `A{1}y`.
- **Identifiers:** strategy variables support multi-character identifiers such as `controller`, `opponent`, and `strategy1`.
- **Bindings:** strategy variables are explicitly bound to agents, e.g. `(controller,1)`.
- **Temporal operators:** the one-goal fragment supports `F`, `G`, and `X`, together with their negated forms.
- **Executable quantifier fragment:** ordered prefixes of the form `E* A*`, including purely existential prefixes.
- **Evaluation:** mixed bounded prefixes are checked directly; they are not decomposed into independent NatATL formulas.

A representative formula is:

    E{2}controllerA{1}opponent:
    (controller,1)(opponent,2)Fgoal

Natural strategies are represented as ordered condition/action decision lists.
The strategy bound limits their complexity.

NatSL uses exact action pruning. If a selected action is unavailable in a state
covered by the strategy, that strategy profile is inadmissible; no implicit
idle-action fallback is introduced.

### Execution Semantics

NatSL exposes two execution schedules over the same strategy-quantification semantics:

1.  **Sequential Semantics**:
    - Existential strategy quantifiers ($\exists$) are evaluated first to find a set of winning strategy trees. 
    - These candidate strategies are then validated against all possible universal counter-strategies ($\forall$) defined in the formula.
    - This reflects a "Proponent-first" view where a winning plan must be robust against any adversary.
2.  **Alternated Semantics**:
    - Verification alternates between existential search and universal validation at each step of the model exploration.
    - This reflects a "Game-theoretic" view where agents react to each other's moves dynamically.

## OATL

### Theoretical Background

OATL extends ATL with demonic cost bounds on coalition strategies over
`costCGS` models.

**Standard Syntax:**
- **Bounded Coalition**: `<A><k> p`
    - `A`: The coalition of agents.
    - `k`: A positive integer cost bound.
- **Operators**: Theory often includes `W` (Weak Until) and `R` (Release); see
  implementation notes for what VITAMIN accepts.

**Semantics (VITAMIN):**
- `<A><k> phi` means coalition `A` has a strategy to enforce `phi` such that
  **every chosen transition** has cost at most `k` (per-step affordability).
  The bound is **not** a cumulative sum along the play (contrast with OL).

### Current Implementation

**Parser Location:** `model_checker/parsers/formulas/OATL/parser.py`

**Supported Syntax:**
1.  **Format**: `<coalition><bound>` (e.g., `<1,2><10>`).
2.  **Temporal Operators**: `X`, `F`, `G`, `U`, `R`, `W` (and their keywords).
3.  **Propositions**: `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.
4.  **Boolean Constants**: Supports `true` and `false`.

**Validation Rules:**
- **Bound Requirement**: A bound is mandatory for every coalition-prefixed temporal operator.
- **Positive Bound**: The bound `k` must be a positive integer (`k >= 1`) with no leading zeros.

**Formula Examples:**
```text
<1><5> F goal
<1,2><10> (safe W unsafe)
<3><2> G stable
```

### Comparison: Theory vs Implementation

| Aspect | Theory | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coalition** | <A> | `<1,2>` (Indices) |
| **Cost Bound** | per-step affordability | each transition cost `<= k` (not path sum) |
| **Temporal Ops**| X, F, G, U (often + R, W) | `X`, `F`, `G`, `U` (R/W rejected at parse) |
| **Propositions**| p, Goal | `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` |

> [!NOTE]
> **Operator Support (R, W):** Release (`R`) and Weak Until (`W`) are **rejected at parse time** for OATL. Use dual forms (for example `!<1><5> (!p U !q)`) or use COTL when R/W operators are required.

> **Cost bound semantics:** Bound `k` limits the cost of each individual transition (per-step affordability), not the cumulative sum along a play.
>
> **Example:** A property like `<1><5> (p R q)` would otherwise need to be written as `<1><5> !(!p U !q)` or `(<1><5> (q U (p && q)) || <1><5> G q)`, which is significantly less readable.

<a id="ol"></a>
## OL

### Theoretical Background

OL is the linear-time cost-bounded logic paired with OATL on `costCGS` models. Formulas use a demonic cost prefix `<Jk>` before temporal operators.

**Standard Syntax:**
- **Cost prefix**: `<Jk> phi` where `k` is a positive integer bound.

### Current Implementation

**Parser Location:** `model_checker/parsers/formulas/OL/parser.py`

**Supported Syntax:**
1.  **Format**: `<Jk>` (e.g., `<J5>`). The letter `J` is mandatory inside the angle brackets.
2.  **Temporal Operators**: `X`, `F`, `G`, `U`, `R`, `W`.
3.  **Propositions**: `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.

**Validation Rules:**
- **Mandatory `J`**: OL prefixes must use `<Jk>`, not bare `<k>`.
- **Bound requirement**: Every temporal operator must be prefixed with `<Jk>`.
- **Positive bound**: `k >= 1`; `<J0>` is rejected.

**Formula Examples:**
```text
<J5> F goal
<J10> G ok
<J3> (p U q)
```

### Comparison: Theory vs Implementation

| Aspect | Theory | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost prefix** | `<Jk>` | `<Jk>` (requires `J`) |
| **Temporal ops** | X, F, G, U | X, F, G, U, R, W |
| **Cost semantics (F/G/U/R/W)** | Path budget | **Accumulated** path cost `<= k` |
| **Cost semantics (X)** | Step budget | **Per-step** transition cost `<= k` |

> [!NOTE]
> **Cost bound semantics:** For `F`, `G`, `U`, `R`, and `W`, bound `k` limits the **sum of transition costs along the considered path**. For `X`, `k` limits only the **next** transition. This differs from OATL, where every operator uses per-step affordability.

<a id="rbatl--rabatl"></a>
## RBATL / RABATL

### Theoretical Background

RBATL and RABATL extend ATL with vector cost bounds on coalition strategies over `costCGS` models.

**Standard Syntax:**
- **Vector bounded coalition**: `<A><b1, b2, ...> phi`
    - `A`: coalition agents.
    - `b1, b2, ...`: per-resource bounds.

### Current Implementation

**Parser locations:** `RBATL/parser.py`, `RABATL/parser.py` (same surface syntax).

**Supported Syntax:**
1.  **Format**: `<coalition><bound1,bound2,...>` (e.g., `<1><10,5>`).
2.  **Temporal Operators**: `X`, `F`, `G`, `U` (`R`/`W` rejected at parser).
3.  **Multi-resource bounds**: comma-separated inside the second angle-bracket group.

**Cost models:**
- **RBATL** uses flat `Costs_for_actions` entries (`agent$cost:cost`).
- **RABATL** uses `Costs_for_actions_split` and sums coalition members' cost components when checking a joint action.

**Semantics (both):** On each coalition-controlled transition, resource `i` consumed must satisfy `cost_i <= b_i` (per-step affordability, not cumulative path totals).

**Formula Examples:**
```text
<1><100,50> F goal
<1,2><10,10,10> G safe
<1><5> (p U q)
```

### Comparison: Theory vs Implementation

| Aspect | Theory | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coalition** | `<A>` | `<1,2>` (indices) |
| **Vector bound** | `<b1, b2, ...>` | `<10,5>` (comma-separated) |
| **Temporal ops** | X, F, G, U | `X`, `F`, `G`, `U` (R/W rejected at parser) |
| **RBATL costs** | Flat action costs | `Costs_for_actions` |
| **RABATL costs** | Split / coalition-sum | `Costs_for_actions_split` |

> [!NOTE]
> **RABATL is not a separate recursive-modality engine** in VITAMIN. It shares `bounded_atl_solver` with RBATL and differs only in how action costs are derived from the model file. Winning sets can differ from RBATL on the same formula when coalition-sum costs disagree with flat costs.

> [!NOTE]
> **Operator Support (R, W):** Release (`R`) and Weak Until (`W`) are rejected at parse time for RBATL/RABATL.

**Validation Rules:**
- **Comma separation**: resource vectors use commas, not colons.
- **Resource count**: bound vector length should match the cost dimension in the model.

<a id="capatl"></a>
## CapATL

### Theoretical Background

CapATL is designed for models with explicit capacity constraints (`capCGS`), often involving knowledge (capability) and agent-scoped properties.

**Standard Syntax:**
- **Coalition modality**: `<{A}> phi` (paper-style agent set; capacities constrain
  available actions via the `capCGS` model, not a formula numeric bound).
- **Knowledge (Capability)**: `Ki p` (Agent `i` has the capability/knowledge of `p`).
- **Agent Property**: `i is prop` (Agent `i` currently possesses property `prop`).

### Current Implementation

**Parser Location:** `model_checker/parsers/formulas/CapATL/parser.py`

**Supported Syntax:**
1.  **Coalition**: `<{agent1,agent2,...}>` (curly braces required; no `, k`).
2.  **Capability**: `K1(p)`, `K2(K3 p)`.
3.  **Agent Properties**: `1 is active`, `2 is critical`.
4.  **Temporal Operators**: `X`, `F`, `G`, `U`, and binary `R` (Release).

**Validation Rules:**
> [!NOTE]
> **Operator Support (W):** Weak Until (`W`) is not part of CapATL path syntax and remains unsupported. Release (`R`) is accepted as a binary operator (`<{A}> phi R psi`) and evaluated by the CapATL solver (greatest fixpoint).
- **Model Requirement**: Can only be verified against `capCGS` models.
- **Formula bound**: `<{A}, k>` is rejected (no numeric `k` in CapATL).

**Formula Examples:**
```text
<{1,2}> F g
<{1}> G a
<{1,2,3}> X a
<{1}> a R g
<{1}> false R g
```

### Comparison: Theory vs Implementation

| Aspect | Theory | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coalition** | ⟨A⟩ / `<{A}>` | `<{A}>` (braces required; no formula `k`) |
| **Capacities** | Model / knowledge | `capCGS` sections + Pre over capacity knowledge |
| **Capability** | Ki p | Parsed as `Ki (...)`; **not evaluated** by the CapATL solver yet |
| **Agent Prop** | i is p | Surface syntax documented; agent-scoped `i is p` is not fully wired in the solver |
| **Temporal** | X, U, R (F/G sugar) | `X, F, G, U, R` (`W` unsupported) |

> [!NOTE]
> **`Ki` / `i is p`:** These forms appear in the CapATL grammar and docs, but the
> bottom-up solver has no dedicated knowledge handler yet. Prefer temporal goals
> over atomic propositions that exist in the model labelling until knowledge
> operators are wired through.

<a id="cotl"></a>
## COTL

### Theoretical Background

COTL is the cost-bounded ATL logic used with `costCGS` models. Formulas share the OATL surface syntax `<A><k> phi` but are checked by a dedicated fixpoint engine (`COTL/COTL.py`), not by OATL per-step filtering.

### Current Implementation

**Parser:** `COTLParser` (`model_checker/parsers/formulas/COTL/parser.py`), same `<coalition><bound>` shape as OATL.

**Supported Syntax:**
1.  **Format**: `<coalition><bound>` (e.g., `<1,2><5>`).
2.  **Temporal Operators**: `X`, `F`, `G`, `U`, `R`, `W` (R/W implemented in the COTL solver).
3.  **Propositions**: `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.

**Semantics:** Coalition `<A><k>` requires that coalition `A` can enforce the sub-formula while keeping transition costs within bound `k` under the COTL cost interpretation (cost-bounded strategy synthesis via least/greatest fixpoints, not OATL per-step filtering).

**Formula Examples:**
```text
<1><10> F goal
<1,2><5> (p U q)
<1><2> G safe
<1><5> (p R q)
```

### Comparison: Theory vs Implementation

| Aspect | Theory | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coalition** | `<A>` | `<1,2>` (indices) |
| **Cost bound** | `<k>` | `<5>` (integer) |
| **Temporal ops** | X, F, G, U | `X`, `F`, `G`, `U`, `R`, `W` |
| **Engine** | Cost-bounded ATL | Dedicated COTL fixpoints (not OATL solver) |

> [!NOTE]
> **COTL vs OATL:** Same parser shape, different checker. OATL uses per-step affordability in `OATL/preimage.py` and rejects R/W. COTL uses its own fixpoint operators and accepts R/W.

---

<a id="wallet_atl"></a>
## Wallet_ATL

ATL with wallet-aware coalitions over `WalletCGS` models.

**Coalition syntax:** `<<agents[:wallet constraints]>>` followed by a temporal formula. The `<<>>` prefix is **mandatory** before `X`, `F`, `G`, or `U`; bare temporal operators without a coalition are rejected.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why `<<>>` instead of `<>`?** Plain ATL uses `<1>` for coalitions only. Wallet_ATL
> embeds optional balance guards (`:wallet(agent, op, value)`) inside the same prefix,
> so the grammar uses a dedicated `<< ... >>` token. That avoids clashing with other
> bracket conventions in VITAMIN: OATL/RBATL `<1><5>` (coalition then cost bound),
> NatATL `<{1}, k>`, CapATL `<{1}>`, and OL `<Jk>`. OATL's two bracket groups are separate tokens;
> Wallet's double brackets are one nested delimiter around agents plus guards.

**Examples:**
```text
<<1>>X auction_active
<<1,2:wallet(1, >= 50)>>G funded
```

**Temporal operators:** `X`, `F`, `G`, `U`.

**Model type:** `WalletCGS`. See [Wallet_ATL usage](Wallet_ATL/usage.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Wallet guards:** Balance filters are applied as a **static** state-name
> constraint from the `Wallets` section (which states currently satisfy the
> guard). They do not yet recompute balances along transitions from deposit/spend
> action encodings.

## ICTL - Intuitionistic CTL

### Theoretical Background

ICTL (Intuitionistic CTL) extends CTL with **intuitionistic propositional
connectives** over **birelational models** (EUMAS 2025, Bozzelli et al.). Each
model has two relations on the same finite state set:

- **`P` (`<=_P`)**: information preorder; truth is monotone as knowledge grows.
- **`R`**: serial transition relation; path quantifiers range over infinite `R`-paths.

Path formulas (`X`, `U`, `R`) use standard CTL semantics on `R`-paths. Only
implication and negation are intuitionistic: `phi -> psi` is checked at all
`P`-refinements of the current state.

**Well-behaved frames (paper):** confluence constraints **C1** and **C2** between
`P` and `R` (EUMAS Def. 1). See [ICTL/algorithm.md](ICTL/algorithm.md).

**Standard syntax (state formulas):**
- Boolean: `->`, `not`, `/\`, `\/` (implication is primitive; no excluded middle).
- Path quantifiers: `E`, `A` over `R`-paths.
- Temporal: `X`, `U`, `R`; surface sugar `F` / `G` after `E` or `A`.

**Sugar encodings (EUMAS25b fixpoints):**
- `EF phi` = `E(T U phi)`
- `EG phi` = `E(bottom R phi)`
- `AF phi` = `A(T U phi)`
- `AG phi` = `A(bottom R phi)`

Classical CTL complement dualities (for example `AF phi` as `S \\ EG(~phi)`) are
**not valid** in ICTL and are not used by the checker.

### Current Implementation

**Parser:** `model_checker/parsers/formulas/ICTL/parser.py` (`ICTLParser`)

**Checker:** `model_checker/algorithms/explicit/ICTL/`

**Model loader:** `parsers/game_structures/birelational_matrix/`
(`BirelationalMatrix`, a `CGS` subclass). Cell labels: `0`, `R`, `P`, `P,R`.
Diagonal cells should be `P` or `P,R` so reflexivity of `P` holds. Metadata:
`model_type: "BirelationalMatrix"`.

**Supported syntax:**
1. **Quantifiers:** `E` / `exist`, `A` / `forall`.
2. **Temporal:** `X`, `U`, `R`; sugar `F` / `G` (also `eventually`, `globally`, etc.).
3. **Boolean:** `&&`, `||`, `!` / `not`, `->` / `implies`.
4. **Propositions:** standard alphabet `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. Path/temporal
   tokens (`E`, `A`, `X`, `F`, `G`, `U`, `R`, keywords) are lexed separately so
   forms such as `EX` / `AG` are operators, not atoms.

**Semantic highlights (set-based model checking):**
- `phi -> psi`, `not phi`: upward closure (`^up`) along `P`.
- `EX phi`: `Pre_exists([[phi]])`; `AX phi`: `Pre_forall([[phi]])` (no `^up` on `AX`).
- `EU` / `AU` / `ER` / `AR`: least / greatest fixpoints per EUMAS25b Theorem 3.
- `EF` / `EG` / `AF` / `AG`: direct fixpoint encodings above (not complement tricks).

**Formula examples:**
```text
EX e
EF e
AX e
AF e
AG (p -> EF q)
AG Goal
E p R q
!(e -> h)
```

**Model type:** `BirelationalMatrix`. Algorithm, C1/C2 validation, and denotations:
[ICTL/algorithm.md](ICTL/algorithm.md).

### Comparison: Theory vs Implementation

| Aspect | Theory (EUMAS25b) | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | Birelational frame + monotone valuation | `BirelationalMatrix` + `check_conditions_hold` |
| **Frame constraints** | C1, C2 (well-behaved) | C1, C2 (EUMAS Def. 1); no paper C3 |
| **`->`, `not`** | Intuitionistic (`^up`) | `handle_implies`, `handle_not` with `^up` |
| **`AX`** | `Pre_forall([[phi]])` | `handle_ax` = `Pre_forall` (no `^up`) |
| **`AF` / `AG`** | `A(T U phi)` / `A(bottom R phi)` | `handle_af` / `handle_ag` (direct fixpoints) |
| **`EF` / `EG` / `EU` / `AU` / `ER` / `AR`** | Standard fixpoints on `R` | Same as paper Figure 7 |
| **Complexity** | `O(|M|^2 * |phi|)` PTIME | Explicit set-based checker |

## IATL - Intuitionistic ATL

### Theoretical Background

IATL (Intuitionistic ATL) extends ATL with **intuitionistic propositional
connectives** and **dual coalition modalities** over BCGS models (Bozzelli et al.,
KR 2025). Each model combines:

- **CGS transitions**: joint action profiles (multi-agent moves).
- **Preorder `P`**: information refinement; intuitionistic truth is monotone along `P`.

**Coalition modalities** (surface syntax `<A>` / `[A]` for paper `<<A>>` / `[[A]]`):

- `<A> phi`: coalition `A` has a strategy enforcing `phi`.
- `[A] phi`: no strategy of `A` can prevent `phi`.

**Well-behaved BCGS (paper Definition 2):** per-coalition constraints **C1** and **C2**
(contravariant simulation of coalition decisions along `P`).

**Sugar encodings (KR 2025 fixpoints):**

- `<A> F phi` = `<A>(T U phi)`; `[A] F phi` = `[A](T U phi)`
- `<A> G phi` = `<A>(bottom R phi)`; `[A] G phi` = `[A](bottom R phi)`

On finitely-branching BCGS, perfect-recall and memoryless semantics coincide
(Theorem 5); the explicit checker uses memoryless coalition pre-images.

### Current Implementation

**Parser:** `model_checker/parsers/formulas/IATL/parser.py`

**Checker:** `model_checker/algorithms/explicit/IATL/`

**Model loader:** `parsers/game_structures/bcgs/` (`BCGS`, a `CGS` subclass).
Files use CGS `Transition` cells (joint actions) plus a boolean `Preorder`
section. Metadata: `model_type: "BCGS"`.

**Coalition pre-images (Proposition 2):**

- `Pre_d(A, X)` (`pre_exists`): some `A`-decision; all opponent responses stay in `X`.
- `Pre_f(A, X)` (`pre_forall`): every `A`-decision; some response lands in `X`.

**Semantic highlights:**

- `phi -> psi`, `! phi`: upward closure (`^up`) along `P`.
- `<A> X phi`: `Pre_d`; `[A] X phi`: `Pre_f` (no `^up` on `[A] X`).
- `U` / `R` / `F` / `G`: fixpoints per Theorem 4 (Figure 4).

**Examples:**
```text
<1>G a
[1,2]F goal
<1,2>U safe
<1>X p
[1]X p
!p
p -> q
```

**Model type:** `BCGS` with separate `Preorder` section. See
[IATL/algorithm.md](IATL/algorithm.md) for validation, denotations, and pipeline.

### Comparison: Theory vs Implementation

| Aspect | Theory (KR 2025) | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | BCGS + monotone valuation | `BCGS` + `check_conditions_hold` |

<a id="tctl---timed-ctl"></a>
## TCTL

Timed CTL over `timedCGS` models. Checking uses a zone graph as the symbolic RTS
and the `rsat` regional labelling algorithm.

**Quantifiers:** `A`, `E` with `F`, `G`, `U` (no `X` or release).

**Clocks:**

- Automaton clocks `X` from the model `Clocks` section.
- Formula clocks `Y` via **FREEZE** `j.phi` (reset `j` to `0`, paper `j.reset(phi)`).
- Guards: standalone `x <= 5` or attachment `phi : x <= c` on subformulas.

**Examples:**
```text
AG a
EF crossing
EF (p : x<=1)
j.(j<=7 U goal)
```

**Model type:** `timedCGS` (`TimedCGS.read_file`).

<a id="tol---timed-obstruction-logic"></a>
## TOL

Linear-style **Timed Obstruction Logic** with demonic cost prefixes over `timedCGS`
models (AAMAS 2025). At each step the Demon may deactivate outgoing transitions
whose total cost is at most `k`; the Adversary chooses a remaining edge.

**Demonic prefix:** `{Jk}` where `k` is a positive integer (paper notation `⟨k⟩`).

**Examples:**
```text
{J5}F a
{J10}G safe
{J3}(p U q)
j.(j<=7 U goal)
```

**Temporal operators:** `F`, `G`, `U`, `R`, `W` (paper); `X` (VITAMIN extension).

**Cost semantics:** `k` is a **per-position** demonic deactivation budget (paper
obstruction game), not cumulative path cost. This differs from OL (`<Jk>` uses
accumulated cost for `F`/`G`/`U`/`R`/`W`).

**Freeze:** `j.phi` resets formula clock `j` to `0` at the current state.

**Model type:** `timedCGS`. Shares the `timed_cgs` parser with TCTL.

<a id="empty-coalition-policy"></a>
## Empty Coalition Policy

VITAMIN does **not** support an empty strategic coalition written as `<>`. In ATL literature an empty coalition can be related to opponent-only or path-level reasoning; in this implementation that overlaps CTL existential quantification (`E`, `EF`, ...) without making the logic explicit.

**Policy:** reject `<> ...` in every logic. Use the correct surface for the property:

| Intent | Use | Do not use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Existential path reachability (CTL) | `EF p` | `<> F p` |
| Strategic coalition (ATL) | `<1> F p`, `<1,2> G p` | `<> F p` |
| Linear path eventually (LTL) | `F p` | `<> F p` |
| Cost-bounded strategy (OATL / RBATL) | `<1><5> F p` | `<> F p`, `<1> F p` without bound |
| Capacity / strategy-bound (NatATL) | `<{1}, 5> F p` | `<> F p` |
| Capacity coalition (CapATL) | `<{1}> F p` | `<> F p` |
| IATL universal coalition | `[1] G p` | `[] G p` (empty `[]` rejected) |

**Where rejection is enforced:**

| Logic | Coalition form | Empty coalition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ATL / ATLF | `<1>`, `<1,2>` | `<> ` rejected (precheck + parser) |
| IATL | `<1>` exist, `[1]` forall | `<> ` and `[]` rejected |
| NatATL | `<{1,2}, k>` | `<\s*>` rejected |
| CapATL | `<{1,2}>` | `<\s*>` rejected |
| OATL / COTL | `<1><5>` | `<\s*>` rejected; bound required |
| RBATL / RABATL | `<1><5>` or `<1><2,2>` | `<\s*>` rejected; bound required |
| OL | `<J5>` (cost, not agents) | N/A |
| Wallet_ATL | `<<1>>` | `<<>>` invalid (lexer) |
| CTL / LTL | `E` / `A` or none | `<> ` invalid syntax |

<a id="atomic-proposition-policy"></a>
## Atomic Proposition Policy

Atomic identifiers for propositions and variables must follow a shared alphabet and must not clash with reserved syntax keywords.

**Standard alphabet (models and most logics):**
- Pattern: `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` (`PROPOSITION_TOKEN` in `syntax_patterns.py`)
- Logics: CTL, LTL, ATL, NatATL, NatSL, OATL, OL, RBATL, CapATL, COTL, ICTL,
  Wallet_ATL
- Examples: `p`, `Goal`, `safe_1`
- Validation: `validate_proposition_identifier()` in
  `model_checker/parsers/formulas/parser_utils.py` (CGS models and Family-B
  formula AST post-validation via `validate_ast()`)

**Reserved keywords (case-insensitive):** `and`, `or`, `not`, `implies`, `until`, `release`, `globally`, `next`, `eventually`, `always`, `forall`, `exist`

**Lexer-specific proposition patterns (modal compound disambiguation):**
- **IATL, TCTL, TOL**: `ICTL_PROPOSITION_TOKEN` /
  `TCTL_TOL_PROPOSITION_TOKEN` =
  `[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*` or `[A-Z][a-z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`. Mixed-case names such as
  `Goal` are supported; all-caps operator-shaped names and single uppercase
  letters (for example `P`) are not proposition tokens.
- **ICTL**: uses the standard alphabet above; `E` / `A` / temporal tokens are
  separate lexer rules (not the restricted `ICTL_PROPOSITION_TOKEN` pattern).
- **NatSL temporal atoms**: Use the standard alphabet above. Single uppercase
  `E` / `A` are rejected after `F` / `!F` because they are quantifier tokens in
  the NatSL lexer.
- **CTL pre-validation**: Bare temporal operators at formula start are detected
  with token-boundary rules, so proposition names such as `Goal` or `Flux` are
  not mistaken for `G` / `F` operators.

**Known limitation (CTL, LTL, ATL, NatATL, and related logics):** A proposition whose name is exactly a modal operator token (for example `F`, `E`, or `EX`) may be unparseable in some positions because the lexer reads it as syntax. Prefer descriptive names (`Goal`, `safe_1`) over single-letter operator aliases.

<a id="model-syntax"></a>
## Model Syntax

VITAMIN supports several model formats. Content-based detection (for generic
loaders) and logic metadata (for `create_model_parser_for_logic`) both matter;
canonical authoring details are in [file_formats.md](file_formats.md).

### CGS (Concurrent Game Structure)
The base model for CTL, LTL, ATL, NatATL, NatSL, and related CGS logics.

**File Sections:**
1.  **Transition**: Matrix (States x States) of joint action profiles. Each non-zero cell lists one or more joints separated by commas. A joint is either compact (`AC` = agent 1 plays `A`, agent 2 plays `C`) or explicit (`A|C`, `IDLE|MOVE`). Both forms are the same per-agent move vector; checkers normalize them to `|`-separated profiles. Use `*` for a full-agent wildcard and `0` for no transition. Every state must have at least one successor (total relation); use a `*` self-loop on terminal states. Cost table keys are normalized to the same pipe form at load time.

    > **Why total transitions?** CTL/ATL (and related) semantics are defined on infinite paths (Baier/Katoen). A state with no successor makes `X` undefined and can make universal next operators hold vacuously. A self-loop means "stay here forever," not that the system has no end state in the modeled domain.
2.  **Unknown_Transition_by**: Typically zeroed matrix for experimental uncertainty.
3.  **Name_State**: Space-separated list of state names.
4.  **Initial_State**: The starting state identifier.
5.  **Atomic_propositions**: Space-separated list of available propositions.
6.  **Labelling**: Binary labelling matrix (States x Propositions).
7.  **Number_of_agents**: Total count of agents in the system.
8.  **Agent_labels** (optional): Whitespace-separated display names for agents
    1..n. Formulas use `<1>`, `<2>`, ...; labels are metadata only.

**Example Action Format:**
For 2 agents, `AC` and `A|C` both mean Agent 1 performs `A` and Agent 2 performs `C`. Prefer compact single-character names in examples; use `|` when an action name has more than one character.

### BirelationalMatrix (ICTL)
Used for ICTL. Loader:
`model_checker/parsers/game_structures/birelational_matrix/`.
Same sectioned layout as CGS, but `Transition` cells are relation labels
`0` / `R` / `P` / `P,R` (not joint actions). Metadata forces this type for ICTL;
generic content detection alone still sees an ordinary CGS-shaped file. See
[ICTL/algorithm.md](ICTL/algorithm.md).

### BCGS (Birelational Concurrent Game Structure)
Used for IATL. Loader: `model_checker/parsers/game_structures/bcgs/`.
CGS-style joint-action `Transition` matrix plus a boolean `Preorder` section
(`0`/`1`). Detected when a `Preorder` header is present. Metadata:
`model_type: "BCGS"`. See [IATL/algorithm.md](IATL/algorithm.md).

### costCGS (CGS with Costs)
Used for OATL, OL, RBATL, RABATL, and COTL.
- **Section**: `Transition_With_Costs`
- **Format**: Same dimensions as the transition matrix. Cells contain cost vectors separated by colons (e.g., `1:2:0` for 3 agents).

### capCGS (CGS with Capacities)
Used for CapATL.
- **Section**: `Capacities` (list of capacity names).
- **Section**: `Capacities_assignment` (mapping matrix: Agents x Capacities).
- **Section**: `Actions_for_capacities` (maps resources directly to actions that consume/replenish them).

### WalletCGS (CGS with Wallets)
Used for Wallet_ATL.
- **Section**: `Wallets` - one line per state, `state: balance1 balance2 ...`.
- Extends standard CGS sections. Actions can encode wallet operations (for example `D20`, `B50`).

### timedCGS (Timed costCGS)
Used for TOL and TCTL. Includes all costCGS sections plus:
- **Section**: `Clocks` - clock variable names.
- **Section**: `Clock_constraints` - bounds and resets on transitions.
- **Section**: `Invariants` - clock invariants per state.
